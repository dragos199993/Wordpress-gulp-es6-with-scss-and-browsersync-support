# How to use?
Remember that you need to specify the correct paths in grunt.js and settings.js.
This will install all needed dependencies.
```sh
$ npm install
```
And then simply run:
```sh
$ grunt watch
```


##### Other:

Careful that package.json file already includes some dependencies that you might not need. Just take a look in package.json and remove with what you need with:
```sh
$ npm remove 'package you want to be removed'
```
